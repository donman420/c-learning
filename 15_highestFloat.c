/*

Write a program that finds the largest in a series of numbers entered by the user. 
The proÂ­gram must prompt the user to enter numbers one by one. 
When the user enters 0 or a negaÂ­ tive number, the program must display 
the largest nonnegative number entered:

Enter a number: 60 
Enter a number: 38.3 
Enter a number: 4.89 
Enter a number: 100.62 
Enter a number: 75.2295 
Enter a number: 0
The largest number entered was 100.62
